# SpaceInvaders

This is a very rudimentary version of Space Invaders while still having all the 
boilerplate to expand it. 

When teaching my son Java programming I found this to be a good example to work on so decided to 
make it available for everyone.

## Building
install [maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

`mvn clean package` will create a zip distribution

`mvn exec:exec` will run the application. To run a fresh build do `mvn clean compile exec:exec`

## Installing
Unzip the SpaceInvaders-1.0-bin.zip to a directory of choice

## Running the installed:
In Windows: Run SpaceInvaders.exe

In Linux: Run SpaceInvaders.sh
